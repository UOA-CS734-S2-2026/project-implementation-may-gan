# Testing and delivery

## Test plan

| Level | Tool and coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Units | Vitest/Dart: dates, permissions, retries, recaps. |
| Database | Isolated PostgreSQL: transactions, constraints, races, grants, outbox. |
| Runtime | Workers Vitest/Wrangler: Hono, bindings, schedules, hibernation, alarms. |
| Contracts | Generate/compile Dart and TypeScript clients; test old-client compatibility. |
| Web/mobile | Playwright, Flutter widgets, physical iOS/Android workflows. |
| Security/load | Negative access tests, fault injection, k6 and device timings. |

Emulators do not prove hardware key protection or every sensor feature. Android screenshot detection excludes ADB captures. Test deployed bindings in isolated staging too.

Use the [implementation reference](implementation-reference.md) to turn mechanisms and remaining setup decisions into testable issues.

## Release gates

- Concurrent posts/messages and retries never duplicate accepted content or bypass daily/request limits.
- Auckland midnight, daylight-saving, leap-day, and incorrect-clock tests pass.
- Alternate routes, caches, media, and sockets never bypass permissions.
- Outbox retries and reconnect catch-up survive lost/duplicate events.
- Ticket replay, expiry, logout, and revocation remain safe after hibernation.
- Failed uploads preserve drafts; cleanup never deletes attached media.
- Provider outages use bounded retries and honest pending/failed states.
- Recovery restores server history; invitation races allow one valid claim.
- No private content or credentials leak through logs, telemetry, URLs, or push.

Performance workloads and targets live in [Scalability](scalability.md).

## Migration and release

1. Record lecturer approval/reuse attribution. Import useful WDCC code without secrets or build output.
2. Establish the monorepo and prove auth/database/native compatibility on Workers.
3. Move reusable services and auth authority into Hono. Temporary tRPC proxies may call Hono, but must not become a competing backend.
4. Add release/audience fields, private uploads, grants, idempotency, tickets, and jobs. Replace process-local SSE with Durable Objects.
5. Complete [MVP phases](mvp.md), remove obsolete routes, run failure/load tests, and rehearse restore/deploy.

CI checks formatting, types, contracts, relevant backend/runtime and frontend tests. Shared changes test all affected apps. Deploy API and web independently; run PostgreSQL migrations separately and declare Durable Object migrations. Keep secrets/signing credentials away from untrusted PRs.

Prefer additive changes for older mobile clients. Document rollback, backup retention, acceptable data loss, and restoration. No runtime tests were run for this documentation-only proposal.

## Team evidence

Split initial leads across mobile, backend/cloud, web/reflection, and messaging/security. Everyone tests, reviews, and explains their AI-assisted changes. Use the course board, reviewed PRs, weekly minutes, user research, native demonstrations, and security/load results as evidence. Track phases against the 4 October 2026 deadline; no weekly capacity estimate has been agreed.
